This book includes some short stories from Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's life and how the teachings from these experiences made an impact on his life. A good read with a simple writing style and easy to undertand language.

## My Notes:

Dreams are not those that we see in our sleep, they should be the ones that never let us sleep.

When troubles come, try to understand the relevance of your sufferings. Adversity always presents opportunities for introspection. His advice meant that in the many setbacks and defeats that destiny had handed me, I have always been able to look writhing for strength.

Know that there is a larger energy and force that can crush our ambitions and plans in the blink of an eye. The only way to survive is face your troubles and rebuild your life.

Making the problem go away without letting it grow and fester is the essence of good management in any situation.

It must always be our inner convictions and strength of beliefs that dictate our actions. External forces, temptations and counsels will always be dinned into us, but those among us who can stand up to what we innately believed to be good and right will finally be at peace with ourselves.

A teacher who has his or her student’s progress in mind is the best possible friend, because the teacher knows how to make sure that you excel.

There is no such thing as an impossible deadline.

Swami Sivananda’s words to Kalam: 'Accept your destiny and go ahead with your life. You are not destined to become an air force pilot. What you are destined to become is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forget this failure, as it was essential to lead you to your destined path. Search, instead, for the true purpose of your existence... Surrender yourself to the wish of God.'

When we tackle obstacles, we find hidden reserves of courage and resilience we did not know we had. And it is only when we are faced with failure do we realize that these resources were always there within us. We only need to find them and move on with our lives.

The best way to win is not to covet the win too much, instead to keep a calm and open mind to new challenges.

While there are areas that I cannot influence, I can certainly do my work to the best and to the most of my abilities, as finally that is all that remains in one's hands.
