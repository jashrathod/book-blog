I read this book some time ago, but very recently, I found myself reading my highlights of this book. Hence, posting it now!

This book takes us on a journey which is much like our life. A story to get inspired for life, and get motivated to keep pursuing our dreams.

## My Notes:

“My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.” “That makes sense,” the alchemist 
answered. “Naturally it’s afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.” “Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?” “Because you 
will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what 
you’re thinking about life and about the world.” “You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?” “Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your 
heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them. “You will never be able to 
escape from your heart. So it’s better to listen to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an unanticipated blow.”

He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone 
makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.

The closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more that Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being.

People need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.

In alchemy, it’s called the Soul of the World. When you want something with all your heart, that’s when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It’s always a 
positive force.

When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream

“DON’T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU’VE LEFT BEHIND,” the alchemist said.

The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, 
and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. “Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, 
“it’s because I’m the heart of a person, and people’s hearts are that way. People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they 
don’t deserve them, or that they’ll be unable to achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of moments 
that could have been good but weren’t, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we 
suffer terribly.”

The fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.

Before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in 
addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the 
point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.

When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.

Trust in your heart, but never forget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one another, the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No 
one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.

If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of 
failure.
