Hey! I'm Jash Rathod and my love for books has motivated me to start this blog.

At first, I would like to thank you for viewing my work. It means a lot!

## What I do

I am a Machine Learning Reasearcher. Recently, I completed my undergrads in Computer Engineering. I have experience working with technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain. I also run a blog where I write about cutting-edge technologies. You can find it here: [Jash Rathod's Tech Blog](https://jashrathod.github.io/)

So yeah, I'm a geek!

## What I read

Mostly, I find myself reading **Non-Fiction**. My favourites are Self Help, Science and Technology, and Finance Books. It would be too early to claim I've read _many_ books to be categorising these types as my favourites, but I enjoy them a lot.

You can find the books I've read in the past on [my goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/jashrathod).
