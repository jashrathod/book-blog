title: Book Notes
---

I find it helpful to make notes and highlights while reading a book. This is just a collection of my notes for the books I've read. It goes without 
saying that this does not serve as a summary of the book. These are ideas that I believe I would like to reflect on some time in the future. Apart from these, 
I have read many more books whose notes are not present here because either I didn't feel the need to make them (eg. fiction) or I read it before I started 
taking notes.
